# Personal web developer's book

Welcome to my personal devbook here i'll huh put info about links learn stuff.
This is a open project btw so don't have start and close date. This will serve as a wiki thing first.
If this helped you in something so give me a star or not.

Thanks.

[I want to go to the devbook](https://github.com/hiagosilverio/web-devbook/wiki)

## Why a devbook?

Well first I was having a contact in college with design and they come with a sketch book. This book teaches design people how to pratice and doing stuff.
So programmers also have one like bootcamp this is how we sharpen the axe. But that is a pratice book in development we have a lot of layers that define what is programming like.

First we have architeture how to program using functional, logical, object oriented and so on, we have ways to do something cascade or scrum, xp project cycles etc.
And we have platforms, cloud, ftp, desktop, mobile. And what to do like apps, stores, systems.. and how to fix errors.

So yes there is a lot of stuff boy. But this devbook is for web developers, is more like a wiki. Maybe this is necessary to be for some reason my personal wiki. But i'm doing this to help others web developers, like frontend and backend guys. I don't know what name to give to it. So I'll stick with devbook sounds good.

Maybe use pwd book.. I dunno. I not a greater programmer that I can tell you everything. But I know how to enter in the road and show the path, like a wizard.
