# Personal web developer's book

Welcome to my personal devbook here i'll huh put info about links learn stuff.
This is a open project btw so it don't have start and close date. This will serve as a wiki thing first.

Thanks.

Btw this is not ready yet. So don't be sad, keep seing updates.

When we learn together, we learn more than alone as always.

[I want to go to the devbook](https://github.com/hiagosilverio/web-devbook/wiki)

## Goals?

* Spread the most information as possible without create double vision tracing real objetives to real jobs.
* Not only spread by spreading being compromissed to help others. But everything in your time.
* What I learn I share. No SCAM, trust me I'm an Analyst.

## Why a devbook?

Well first I was having a contact in college with design and they come with a sketch book. This book teaches design how to pratice and doing stuff.
So programmers also have one like codecamp this is how we sharpen the axe. But that is a pratice book in development we have a lot of layers that define what is programming like.

First we have architeture how to program using functional, logical, object oriented and so on, we have ways to do something cascade or scrum, xp project cycles etc.
And we have platforms cloud ftp desktop mobile. And what to do like apps stores systems.. and how to fix errors.

So yes there is a lot of stuff boy. But this devbook is for web developers is more like a wiki. Maybe this is necessary to be for some reason my personal wiki. But i'm doing this to help others web developers, like frontend and backend guys. I don't know what name to give to it. So I'll stick with devbook it sounds good.

Maybe use pwd book.. I dunno. I not a greater programmer that I can tell you everything. But I know how to enter in the road and show the path like a wizard.

Contribuitions that I see that is relevant for scenario I give the necessary credits to the autor. I'm not here to stole info but spread it.
